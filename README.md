Ultramajic
==================

Playing with Three.js and some primitive 3D as eye candy for my Ultramajic release.

In Chrome:

http://ultramajic.herokuapp.com/

If you wish to run it and locally and you have either the Heroku toolbelt/Foreman Gem installed,
start the application with `foreman start` to fire up the Node based Express.js and navigate to http://localhost:5000/.

Thanks
